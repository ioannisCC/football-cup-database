# football-cup-database

A relational model database made for a university assignment.
I provide the SQL code as well as the exported files and the documentation in greek ( [documentation_databases.pdf](https://github.com/ioannisCC/football-cup-database/files/12252708/documentation_databases.pdf) ). The assignment outline (also in greek) can also be found in the files.
